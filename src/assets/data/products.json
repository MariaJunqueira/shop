    "description": "Peas are not actually a vegetable but a small, edible legume and as such they belong to the same family as lentils, chickpeas, beans and peanuts. Peas grow in pods on a vine and once the pod is plump, they are ripe for picking. In the UK, peas are in season from May to October, but the majority of peas we consume are frozen, making them an all year staple.",

    "name": "Eggs",
    "description": "Eggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white, and the temperature determines the gelling time. Egg yolk becomes a gel, or solidifies, between 61 and 70 째C (142 and 158 째F). Egg white gels at different temperatures: 60 to 73 째C (140 to 163 째F). The white contains exterior albumen which sets at the highest temperature. In practice, in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer.",
